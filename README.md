# Python 3 / Django 2-based real-estate website

:heavy_exclamation_mark: This has been developed for learning Django 2+ & Python 3+ & Microsoft Azure & DevOps (Docker, Traefik, etc.) and many other new technologies.
This project is in the state of development. 

:triangular_flag_on_post: To create something akin to <https://www.wg-gesucht.de> which would provide students and landlords a way to advertise their free rooms.

The "source of creating such web application" was an article <https://www.respekt.cz/sousede/nekolik-nezavislych-lidi-bydli-v-jednom-pronajatem-byte>. 

**Briefly:** In the Czech Republic, there are a lot of real-estate portals but very few exist which are dedicated to just student housing. 
Facebook/Social media and university forums are addressing the need in this space.

Compared to <https://www.wg-gesucht.de> (in Germany), in a similar form and scale there is nothing* and thus the objective is to create a web application which fills the gap. 

`*` Never say never.
