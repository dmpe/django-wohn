# Azure Functions

We used **Azure Functions** to react or trigger events (functions) for some tasks, namely:

    - Getting forex exchange data from (central) banks and storing them in the database.
    - When creating real estate posting, user can send pictures via email (instead of uploading them).
    - [See GitHub issue](https://github.com/dmpe/django-wohn/issues/7) for more ideas.
